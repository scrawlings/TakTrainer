# Tak: A Beautiful Game

Based on the writing of Patrick Rothfuss and developed as a game by James Ernest in collaboration with Patrick Rothfuss, Tak is a beautiful game.

This project implements the game with in the intention of making a robot player and also to analyse different strategies. In part it is also to develop my own playing because it really is a beautiful game that has captured my imagination.

  * Create a new board from a move the old board
  * Output moves in standard notation
  * Accept input moves in standard notation
  * Apply anaylsis to boards and ranking heuristics
  * Apply minimax analysis to play a game
  * Visualise the baord in some useful way
  * Play two robots
  * Random first moves
  * Remember heuristic choices and match to game outcomes
  * Push to GIT
  * Analyse performance and optimise
  * Consider which language I'd like to present this with
